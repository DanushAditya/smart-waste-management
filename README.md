# 🧠 Smart Waste Management System (Frontend)

A React-based smart waste tracking system that allows citizens to report public waste with photo and location. The app uses an AI model to assess the severity of waste (scale of 1–10), installs smart bins if necessary, and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to suggest the most efficient collection routes for garbage trucks.
