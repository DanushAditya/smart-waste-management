# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# 🧠 Smart Waste Management System

An intelligent waste management platform that leverages AI to detect and rate the severity of public waste from uploaded images. The system recommends actions based on waste levels, installs smart bins if needed, and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find optimal routes for garbage truck collection.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Citizens upload photos of public waste with location
- 🤖 AI model analyzes waste severity (scale of 1 to 10)
- 🗑️ If severe, a smart bin is scheduled for installation
- 🔄 Smart bins send alerts when full
- 📍 Admin dashboard uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to plan efficient garbage collection routes

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **AI Model**: Integrated waste severity detector (placeholder or trained model)
- **Routing Algorithm**: Dijkstra’s algorithm implementation
- **Backend**: *(Planned for integration with Spring Boot or Node.js)*

---

## 📸 Screenshots

*(Add screenshots of your UI, AI output, route optimization screen here)*

---

## 🔧 Future Enhancements

- Full integration with IoT smart bins
- Real-time AI waste detection using live camera feeds
- SMS/email notifications for bin status
- Admin-level analytics dashboard
