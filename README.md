# 🧠 Smart Waste Management System

An intelligent waste management platform that leverages AI to detect and rate the severity of public waste from uploaded images. The system recommends actions based on waste levels, installs smart bins if needed, and uses Dijkstra's algorithm to find optimal routes for garbage truck collection.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 📷 Citizens upload photos of public waste with location
- 🤖 AI model analyzes waste severity (scale of 1 to 10)
- 🗑️ If severe, a smart bin is scheduled for installation
- 🔄 Smart bins send alerts when full
- 📍 Admin dashboard uses Dijkstra’s algorithm to plan efficient garbage collection routes

---

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React.js
- **AI Model**: Integrated waste severity detector (placeholder or trained model)
- **Routing Algorithm**: Dijkstra’s algorithm implementation
- **Backend**: *(Planned for integration with Spring Boot or Node.js)*
